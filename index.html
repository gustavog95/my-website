                        <p class="card-text text-secondary">My coding journey began April of 2022. My wife, Jeannie and I had recently found out that she was pregnant. Later on that week I dreaded the idea of having to go back to work. I was thinking of a profession that I could get into that would allow me to spend more time with my family. I have worked retail my entire life and I was ready to really give coding a try. I am motivated and I truly believe I will become a web developer, not just for my family but for myself. I love to code. I am currently studying full stack Javascript web development through The Odin Project. This website is going to be used to draft new subjects I learn along my journey. I look forward to sharing my journey with everyone.</p>
